## The Divine City

In the classical period, Athens was a center for the arts,
learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Akademia and
Aristotle's Lyceum, Athens was also the birthplace of
Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles, and many other prominent
philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world. It
is widely referred to as the cradle of Western Civilization, and
the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of its
cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th
centuries BC on the rest of the then known European continent.
