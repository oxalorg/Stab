Welcome to Athens, by [owlofathena.com](http://owlofathena.com).

## Some backstory linking Athens to Athena

Athena competed with Poseidon to be the patron deity of
Athens, which was yet unnamed, in a version of one founding
myth. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one
gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they
preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a
salt water spring sprang up; this gave them a means of trade
and water—Athens at its height was a significant sea power,
defeating the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis—but the
water was salty and not very good for drinking

Athena, however, offered them the first domesticated olive
tree. The Athenians (or their king, Cecrops) accepted the
olive tree and with it the patronage of Athena, for the
olive tree brought wood, oil, and food. Robert Graves was of
the opinion that "Poseidon's attempts to take possession of
certain cities are political myths" which reflect the conflict
between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.
