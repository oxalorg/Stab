# Stab

Start blogging w/ this Simple static blog generator.

***Some features***:

* 82 lines of code.
* ***EASY*** to use. 
  
  *Got fed up of the complexity of `jekyll`, `pelican` and
   other complex softwares for such an easy task.*

## Quick start

***Setup***:

1. Install

        pip3 install stab

2. Clone the source of this site as a base to build upon.

        git clone https://github.com/oxalorg/stab-site


***Write some posts***:

* All your markdown posts go inside `./blog` directory.
* They must have valid ***yaml frontmatter*** as required
  by your templates.
* The one in this repo only required a `title` and `date`
  values.
* Find examples in the `./blog` directory of this repo.

Then build the site with

```
$ stab
```

That's it. If you've ever used another static site generator,
this should be enough for you to get started and build.

If you're still not convinced of how easy this is, head over
to the [docs](docs). I'll be posting a series of concise
articles explaining *everything* ;)
